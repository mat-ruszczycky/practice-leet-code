# Practice Leet Code

This is repo is for tracking solutions and explanations to Leet programs. In addition, this repository aims to offer resources and explanations on common practices, principles, and approaches within software engineering.

## Approach

Problems are solved using vanilla JavaScript and saved within a local `html` file. In this approach, there is no need to run a local server or install libraries for it to run. Users should be able to open the solution `html` file locally in any browser and view the output within the developer console.
